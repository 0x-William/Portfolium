"privacy" = "Privacy Policy\n\nYour privacy is critically important to us. At Portfolium, we have a few fundamental principles:\n\n- We don't ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. (We can't stand services that ask you for things like your gender or income level for no apparent reason.)\n\n- We don't share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.\n\n- We don't store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.\n\nBelow is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals: \n\nPortfolium (Portfolium) operates portfolium.com. It is Portfolium's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our website.\n\nWebsite Visitors Like most website operators, Portfolium collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Portfolium's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Portfolium's visitors use its website. From time to time, Portfolium may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website. Portfolium also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users. Portfolium only discloses logged in user IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.\n\nGathering of Personally-Identifying Information:\nCertain visitors to Portfolium website choose to interact with Portfolium in ways that require Portfolium to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Portfolium gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who request an account to provide their name, school information and email address. Portfolium collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with Portfolium. Portfolium does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.\n\nAggregated Statistics:\nPortfolium may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. Portfolium may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Portfolium does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.\n\nProtection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information:\nPortfolium discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Portfolium's behalf or to provide services available at Portfolium's website, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Portfolium's websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Portfolium will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Portfolium discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Portfolium believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Portfolium, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of Portfolium website and have supplied your email address, Portfolium may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with Portfolium and our products. We primarily use our blog to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Portfolium takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.\n\nCookies:\nA cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Portfolium uses cookies to help Portfolium identify and track visitors, their usage of Portfolium website, and their website access preferences. Portfolium visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Portfolium's website, with the drawback that certain features of Portfolium's website may not function properly without the aid of cookies.\n\nPrivacy Policy Changes:\nAlthough most changes are likely to be minor, Portfolium may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Portfolium's sole discretion. Portfolium encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.\n\nThis Privacy Policy was crafted from Wordpress.com's version, which is available under a Creative Commons Sharealike license.\n\n";
